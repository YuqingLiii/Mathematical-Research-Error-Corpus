**Context (annotation, not a source quotation):** The scalar variables are n=D^2-1, u=Tr(P), v=Tr(B), x=Tr(BP), a=Tr(B^2), and b=Tr(P^2). Centered-Align is the Hilbert–Schmidt bound after subtracting scalar parts.

**Source binding:** `prior_source_check_not_repeated_as_exact_match` (inherited; not rechecked here).

## Witness

A necessary lower endpoint is omitted while the displayed system is called complete.

### Argument or calculation

Hilbert–Schmidt Cauchy–Schwarz gives |x-uv/n|<=sqrt((a-v^2/n)(b-u^2/n)). Thus it entails both x<=uv/n+sqrt(...) and x>=uv/n-sqrt(...). The displayed system retained only the upper endpoint. For example, a=v^2/n and b=u^2/n force x=uv/n, while the one-sided bound alone allows every smaller x. This demonstrates the missing constraint, not infeasibility of the particular numerical survivor.

Scope: argument_invalid.

The diagnosis above is curator-written. Bundling a review or output does not rerun its mathematics.
